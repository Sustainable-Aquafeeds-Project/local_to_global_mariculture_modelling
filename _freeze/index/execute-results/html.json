Note that some scripts require access to raw data which is not stored on Github. \nWhile this page (the index) has code that runs prior to rendering, all code in the subsequent pages has not been run for rendering.\n\n## Main analysis\n\nThe main analysis for this project focuses on the differences in total protein, carbohydrate, lipid and nitrogen losses between feeds. \n\n| Page | Description |\n|---------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| **[Data Tidying](01_tidying_data.html)** | Initial data tidying and preparation |\n| **[Extracting Production Locations](02_extracting_production_locations.html)** | Identification and processing of mariculture production site locations |\n| **[Assessing Species Potential](03_assessing_species_potential.html)** | Evaluation of species suitability for different locations |\n| **[Extracting Temperatures](04_extracting_temperatures.html)** | SST data extraction and processing for model inputs |\n| **[Formulating Feeds](05_formulating_feeds.html)** | Feed composition formulation for model runs |\n| **[Running Atlantic Salmon Model](06_run_atlantic_salmon_model.html)** | Atlantic salmon growth model execution |\n\n## Extra analysis\n\nThe extra analyses for this project involved some exploration into potential impacts of nutrient losses. This will likely not make it into the final manuscript. \n\n| Page | Description |\n|---------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| **[Species Layers](07_species_layers.html)** | Spatial analysis of species distribution layers |\n| **[Relative N Inputs](08_relative_N_inputs.html)** | Analysis of nitrogen input patterns and their relative impacts |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Model functioning\n\n## Population and biomass\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nEach farm's final population was calculated by dividing the production tonnage required by the average modelled individual harvest size for each farm (when feed reference feed, @fig-harvest-size). A population timeseries was then generated using the standard mortality rate (0.06 % d$^{-1}$). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Frequency distribution of harvest sizes used to create the population timeseries for each farm, as predicted by the fish-growth model. ](index_files/figure-html/fig-harvest-size-1.png){#fig-harvest-size fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing this method, a farm's 'population' is not a good representation of the actual number of individuals being farmed, but it ensures each farm location is producing the correct tonnage while allowing comparisons between the different feeds. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nBy this method, farm biomass as predicted by the model predicted farm tonnage relatively accurately. Predicted farm biomass was within -3.2% -- 3% of tonnage produced.\n\n## Feed provision and feeding response to temperature {#sec-model-feeding}\n\n# Modelled experimental feeds {#sec-feeds}\n\n# Model sensitivity to parameter changes {#param-sensitivity}\n\nParameter sensitivity was tested by varying each parameter by $\\pm 10$% and calculating sensitivity as $S_p = \\frac{(P_{1.1} - P_{0.9})}{0.2 \\times P_1}$, where $S$ is the sensitivity of the measured variable to changes in parameter $p$, and $P_{1.1}$, $P_{0.9}$, and $P_{1}$ are the value of the measured variable when the model is run with parameter $p$ at 110%, 90%, and 100% of its value respectively. \nAll parameters in Table @tbl-params were tested. The population-level parameters ($\\overline{W}$, $\\Delta{W}$, $\\overline{I_{max}}$, $\\Delta{I_{max}}$, $\\overline{F}$, $\\Delta{F}$) were tested with a population of of 5000 on a random 10% of farms, while all other parameters were tested across all farms with a population of 10.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Inputs {#inputs}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Total inputs (uneaten and excreted)\n\n### Through time\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Initial look at excreted and uneaten through time](index_files/figure-html/fig-uneat-excr-plot-ts-1.png){#fig-uneat-excr-plot-ts fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nWhile the actual difference in excreted and uneaten feed (total loss) varied between countries and through time (@fig-uneat-excr-plot-ts), relative changes between the feeds remained consistent. \nIn both the US and Australia (all done so far), total excreted faeces was \n23% ($\\pm$ 0.1%) higher in the plant-dominant feed. \nDifferences in total uneaten feed were much smaller at \n0.2% ($\\pm$ 0.1%) lower in the plant-dominant feed.\n\n### At harvest\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Caption](index_files/figure-html/uneat-excr-plot-end-1.png){fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## N inputs\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Caption](index_files/figure-html/N-loss-plot-total-1.png){fig-align='center' width=816}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Code and packages used\n\nAll analysis was conducted in R version 4.4.2 \"Pile of Leaves\" [@R_base]. \nMajor packages used include packages `aquamapsdata`, version 0.1.6 [@aquamapsdata], `arrow`, version 20.0.0.2 [@arrow], `dplyr`, version 1.1.4 [@dplyr], `furrr`, version 0.3.1 [@furrr], `future`, version 1.58.0 [@future], `ggplot2`, version 3.5.2 [@ggplot2], `lubridate`, version 1.9.4 [@lubridate], `magrittr`, version 2.0.3 [@magrittr], `rnaturalearth`, version 1.1.0 [@rnaturalearth], `sf`, version 1.0.21 [@sf], `stringr`, version 1.5.1 [@stringr], `targets`, version 1.11.3 [@targets], `terra`, version 1.8.60 [@terra], `tidyr`, version 1.3.1 [@tidyr], `units`, version 0.8.7 [@units], and `worrms`, version 0.4.3 [@worrms].\n\nFor a full list of R packages used see the lockfile on [Github](https://www.github.com).\nThis manuscript was written in Quarto [@quarto] using TinyTex [@tinytex] and the acronyms extension [@acronyms]. \n",
