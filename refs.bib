	abstract = {To understand dispersal and assimilation of aquaculture waste subsidies in a naturally low-productivity environment, we applied a novel, rapid transmethylation technique to analyse sediment and biota fatty acid composition. This technique was initially validated at Atlantic salmon farms in Macquarie Harbour, Australia, where sediments were collected at farm and control locations. Subsequently, sediment, benthic polychaete and zooplankton were sampled at sites 0, 50, 250, 500 and 1000 m distant from multiple cages. Results demonstrated an acute deposition zone up to 50 m from cages and a diffuse zone extending 500 m from cages. Changes in sediment concentration of linoleic acid, oleic acid and total fatty acids were effective tracers of farm deposition. Bacterial biomarkers indicated that aquaculture waste stimulates bacterial productivity in sediments, with elevated biomarker concentrations also detected in benthic polychaetes. Overall, fatty acid analysis was a sensitive technique to characterize the benthic footprint of aquaculture influence.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture of higher trophic level species is increasingly dependent on the use of terrestrial oil products. The input of terrestrially derived n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into marine environments has subsequently increased, with unknown consequences for recipient species. We exposed a sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma to three experimental diets for 78 days: a high n-3 PUFA marine imitation treatment, a high n-6 PUFA “future aquafeed” treatment and an intermediate “current aquafeed” treatment. Female urchins fed the high n-6 PUFA diet produced larvae with lower survival rates than all other treatments. Males fed the high n-6 PUFA diet produced no viable sperm. Fatty acid composition in reproductive material revealed comprehensive biosynthetic and dietary sparing capabilities in H. erythrogramma. Despite this, the ratio of n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA in reproductive tissue increased significantly with diet. We suggest alterations to this ratio is the likely mechanism of negative impact on larval development.},

	abstract = {Trophic subsidies can drive widespread ecological change, thus knowledge of how keystone species respond to subsidies is important. Aquaculture of large carnivorous fish generates substantial waste as faeces and lost feed, providing a food source to mobile benthic invertebrates. We used a controlled feeding study combined with a field survey to better understand the interaction between salmon aquaculture and the sea urchin, Echinus acutus, a dominant mobile invertebrate in Norwegian fjords. We tested if diets affected urchin fatty acid composition by feeding them one of three diet treatments (“aquafeed”, “composite” and “natural”) for 10 weeks. To test if proximity to fish farms altered E. acutus fatty acid composition, populations were sampled at 10 locations in Hardangerfjord and Masfjord (Western Norway) from directly adjacent and up to 12 km from farms. Fatty acids were measured in gonads and eggs in the diet experiment and in gonads and gut contents from wild animals. Urchins directly assimilated aquaculture waste at farm sites, as evidenced by elevated linoleic acid (LA), oleic acid (OA) and ∑LA, OA in their tissues. The diet experiment highlighted the biosynthetic and selective dietary sparing capacity of E. acutus in both gonads and eggs, with evidence for the elongation and desaturation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) from C18 fatty acid precursors. Elevated biosynthesis of non-methylene interrupted (NMI) fatty acids, in particular 20:3Δ7,11,14 and 20:2 Δ5,11, were also linked to a high C18 fatty acid, low ≥ C20 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) diet. Fatty acid composition of gonads of wild urchins indicated a highly variable diet. The study indicates that the generalist feeding ecology of E. acutus, coupled with extensive biosynthetic capacity, enables it to exploit aquaculture waste as an energyrich trophic subsidy.},

	abstract = {Environmental management of coastal aquaculture is focused on acute impacts of organic and nitrogenous wastes close to farms. However, the energy-rich trophic subsidy that aquaculture provides may create cascades with influences over broader spatial scales. In a fjord region with intensive fish farming, we tested whether an ecosystem engineer, the white urchin Gracilechinus acutus, was more abundant at aquaculture sites than control sites. Further, we tested whether diets influenced by aquaculture waste altered reproductive outputs compared with natural diets. Urchins formed barrens at aquaculture sites where they were 10 times more abundant (38 urchins m−2) than at control sites (4 urchins m−2). Urchins were on average 15 mm larger at control sites. In the laboratory, urchins fed aquafeed diets had 3 times larger gonad indices than urchins fed a natural diet. However, their reproduction was compromised. Eggs from females fed an aquafeed diet had 13\% lower fertilisation success and 30\% lower larval survival rates at 10 d compared with females fed a natural diet. A reproductive output model showed that enhanced numbers of 10 d old larvae produced by the dense aquaculture-associated aggregations of G. acutus will supersede any detrimental effects on reproduction, with larval outputs from aquaculture sites being on average 5 times greater than control sites. The results show that aquaculture waste can act as a trophic subsidy in fjord ecosystems, stimulating aggregations of urchins and promoting the formation of urchin barrens. Where finfish aquaculture is concentrated, combined effects on the wider environment may produce ecosystem-level consequences.},

Aquaculture now provides \&gt;50\% of the global seafood supply, a share that is expected to increase to at least 60\% within the next decade. Aquaculture is an important tool for reducing resource consumption in global protein production and increasing resilience to climate change and other global disruptions (i.e. pandemics, geo‐political instability). Importantly, blue foods also provide essential nutrition for a growing human population. Blue foods are helping to help the global goal of ‘zero hunger’ (United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 2) while reducing the dependency on finite natural resources but further refinement and new solutions are needed to make the industry more ‘circular’ and sustainable, particularly with respect to sourcing raw materials for aquafeeds. This review describes the feed resources that are available or may be created within a circular bioeconomy framework, their role within the framework and in aquaculture and ultimately, how these resources contribute to de‐risking and establishing a resilient aquaculture production chain.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is a growing global food production sector that aims to meet the increasing demand for dietary protein. Crustaceans are an important and predominantly high-priced aquaculture segment that could support the transfer of sustainable new technologies to other sectors. Areas of interest include disease management and compound feeds, both of which have the potential to improve both the profitability and sustainability of aquaculture. Modern compound feeds are largely composed of fishmeal and/or terrestrial plant materials, the production of which is unsustainable, leading to the depletion of finite resources. Insects are a promising protein-rich alternative to fishmeal that can reduce the environmental footprint of aquafeeds and crustacean aquaculture. First research data have shown that insect meal has a favourable nutritional composition with positive health effects, and is environmentally sustainable with a strong economic potential, particularly supporting circular economy by valorising otherwise unused side-streams. In this article, we discuss the current state of crustacean aquaculture and highlight the benefits of insect meal compared to today’s compound aquafeeds in terms of health and growth-promoting properties as well as environmental benefits. We then consider the molecular mechanisms that confer immunity and disease resistance in crustacean aquaculture and show how insect feeds can support disease management and thus consumer health. Next, we assess the environmental sustainability of crustacean aquaculture and insect farming, the legal framework for insect-based feeds and consumer acceptance issues. Lastly, we identify research gaps, socioeconomic considerations and the potential of insect-based sustainable crustacean aquaculture for the global market.},

	abstract = {Adjusting aquafeed to obtain sustainable growth and maximum profit margin of harvest is a worthy stride toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations. Therefore, this research aimed at modeling of nutritional behavior and harvest profit margin in fattening pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) fed on balanced digestible protein (BDP) contents and raised in an intensive recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). The feeding trial consisted of six treatments with three randomly arranged replicates (tanks) per treatment. A total of ten fattening pacus (490.60 ± 14.39 g, initial weight) were stocked per tank. Six experimental feeds containing the increasing contents (163, 201, 238, 272, 315, and 348 g kg-1 diet, dry matter) of BDP were manually fed to the fish for seven weeks three times a day until apparent satiation. The data obtained over the test diets were assessed through appropriate statistical procedures and mathematical models. Optimal levels of BDP were calculated for different nutritional and economic scenarios. Feed cost showed an ascending linear relationship with the BDP intake. Feed intake, feed efficiency, final body weight, weight gain, and specific growth rate (\%) showed an inverted U-shaped quadratic behavior (P {\textless} 0.05). Feed conversion ratio showed a U-shaped quadratic behavior (P {\textless} 0.05). Protein efficiency ratio significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased linearly in response to the increasing BDP contents. Final weights of the eviscerated and sliced fish showed an ascending linear behavior, but the overall effect was insignificant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between the treatments. Whole body moisture and crude protein content increased (P {\textless} 0.05) linearly, while the whole body lipid content decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) linearly over the increasing BDP intake. Whole body ash content showed a U-shaped quadratic behavior (P {\textless} 0.05). The nutritionally optimal BDP content corresponding to the maximum gain in body weight of fattening pacu was calculated as 292 g kg-1 diet (dry matter). To obtain sustainable growth and maximum profit margin of harvest when it will be sold in the form of whole-body, eviscerated, and sliced fish the economically functional BDP intakes were calculated as 249, 256, and 260 g kg-1 diet (dry matter), respectively. This research revealed that the optimal BDP intake greatly improve the nutritional performance of fattening pacu. Moreover, harvest profit margin and eventually the economically sustainable BDP intakes were found dependent on the way the fish harvest is marketed and the changes in total feed cost.},

	abstract = {Fish oil is primarily extracted from small marine pelagic fishes, reducing their availability for marine wildlife forage and artisanal fishing catches that support food security in lower income coastal nations. A primary use of fish oil is in feeds for aquaculture, the world’s fastest growing food sector. Efforts to transition fed aquaculture to sustainability includes replacing fish oil in aquafeeds with more environmentally responsible alternative ingredients. The heterotrophic marine microalga Schizochytrium sp., one of the first commercialized alternatives, lacks an open-access, systematic analysis of environmental impacts of substituting fish oil with heterotrophic microalgae from biorefineries. This study compared the “cradle to factory-gate” life cycle impacts of fish oil to whole-cell or extracted oil of Schizochytrium combined with canola oil. We conducted an attributional life cycle assessment using inventory data collected from published literature and patents and received feedback on commercial relevance of model assumptions from industry advisors. We examined sugar from a Brazilian sugarcane biorefinery and sucrose from U.S. sugar beets as feedstocks for heterotrophic cultivation of Schizochytrium; and compared life cycle impacts of extracting Schizochytrium oil using solvent-free microwave extraction to conventional solvent extraction. Results were that: cultivation processes had the largest overall effect for both products in both regions; whole-cell Schizochytrium combined with canola oil had significantly lower environmental impacts, in all assessed categories, than Schizochytrium oil blended with canola oil; and conventional solvent extraction had significantly lower environmental impacts compared to solvent-free microwave extraction except global warming potential. Schizochytrium products, compared to fish oil, had substantially lower biotic resource depletion and, in the case of whole cells combined with canola oil, had significantly lower global warming potential but higher impacts for all other categories, primarily because commercial Schizochytrium production used sugar feedstocks as carbon and energy sources. The mix of lower and higher environmental impacts of Schizochytrium products illustrates the importance of openly identifying environmental trade-offs to inform evidence-based decisions for commercial practices. Environmental impacts should also be weighed against potential human health benefits of maintaining omega-3 fatty acids and avoiding contaminants in fish flesh when considering alternatives to fish oil.},

	abstract = {The use of insect meal in aquafeed formulations has recently gained attention. Detailed knowledge about the inclusion levels for pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ), a promising candidate for intensive aquaculture in Europe remains, however, fragmented. In the present study, 4 isoproteic (45\% dry matter) and isoenergetic (21 MJ/kg) diets were formulated, including a control diet (H0) containing 30\% fishmeal (FM) on an as fed basis and the other 3 diets in which FM protein was replaced by defatted black soldier fly meal ( Hemetia illucens ) (HIM) at 25\%, 50\%, and 100\% (diet abbreviation H9, H18 and H36, corresponding to an inclusion level of 9\%, 18\% and 36\%, respectively). The feeding trial was performed in triplicate groups of 50 juvenile pikeperch (mean weight, 68.7 g) fed with experimental diets for 84 d during which the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fillet quality and economic and environmental sustainability of rearing pikeperch were evaluated. Our findings indicated that pikeperch fed H0, H9, and H18 groups displayed better results regarding growth performance indices, except for survival rate where no significant difference among groups was recorded ( P = 0.642). A significantly lower organ-somatic index, including hepatosomatic, viscerosomatic and perivisceral fat index, was found in fish fed H18 groups than other groups ( P {\textless} 0.05). Inclusion of HIM affected the digestibility of the nutrients and resulted in an almost linear reduction in the apparent digestibility coefficient of dry matter and protein. Concerning the fillet quality, dietary HIM negatively affected the protein and ash contents of the fish fillets, while the crude fat remained unchanged. Dietary HIM did not significantly modify total saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fillets of fed pikeperch ( P {\textgreater} 0.05) but did reduce total n-3 fatty acids ( P = 0.001) and increased total n-6 ( P {\textless} 0.001). Increasing inclusion levels of HIM reduced the environmental impacts associated with fish-in-to-fish out ratio but entailed heavy burdens on energy use and eutrophication. Low and moderate inclusion levels of HIM did not negatively affect land use and water use compared to an HIM-free diet ( P {\textgreater} 0.05). The addition of HIM at a level as low as 9\% elicited a similar carbon footprint to that of the control diet. The economic conversion ratio and economic profit index were negatively affected at increased insect meal inclusion levels. This study has shown that the incorporation of HIM in feed formulations for pikeperch is feasible at inclusion levels of 18\% without adverse effects on growth performance parameters. The feasibility also highlighted the environmental benefits associated with land use and marine resources required to produce farmed fish.},

	abstract = {We retrieved data from various studies to investigate the consequences of insect meal production and insect meal-based diets with respect to their environmental impact, including global warming potential, energy use, land use, water use, acidification, eutrophication as well as to economic fish-in fish-out ratio and solid waste output production. Analysis indicated that insect meals’ production exerted positive effects on land use but was associated with greater energy use and a larger carbon footprint compared to conventional protein sources. Substitution of silkworm meal (Bombyx mori) meals for fishmeal in aquatic animal diets significantly reduced solid phosphorus waste compared to insect-free diets. In contrast, the inclusion of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens), housefly (Musca domestica), mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) and grasshopper (Zonocerus variegatus) has led, in comparison to insect-free diet, to greater solid nitrogen waste. Reducing the proportion of fishmeal and, to a lesser extent fish oil, by various insect meals in aquatic diet formulations significantly reduces economic fish-in fish-out, indicating less marine forage fish required per unit fish yield. The simulated data showed environmental benefit associated with land use of insect-containing aquafeeds compared to insect meal-free feeds, especially insect species of M. domestica and T. molitor. In all, this study suggested a trade-off of using insect meal as an aquafeed ingredient regarding environmental consequence. Since insect meal has excellent potential to supply protein for aquafeeds in the coming years, improvement in insect meal production systems and nutritional composition will be essential to make insect meal a sustainable aquafeed ingredient.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid global expansion of the aquaculture industry, access to key feedstuffs (fishmeal and fish oil) is becoming increasingly limited because of the finite resources available for wild fish harvesting. This has resulted in other sources of feedstuffs being investigated, namely plant origin substitutes for fishmeal and fish oil for aquafeed. Conventional land-based crops have been favored for some applications as substitutes for a portion of the fishmeal, but they can result in changes in the nutritional quality of the fish produced. Microalgae can be regarded as a promising alternative that can replace fishmeal and fish oil and ensure sustainability standards in aquaculture. They have a potential for use in aquaculture as they are sources of protein, lipid, vitamins, minerals, pigments, etc. This comprehensive review summarizes the most important and recent developments of microalgae use as supplement or feed additive to replace fishmeal and fish oil for use in aquaculture. It also reflects the microalgal nutritional quality and digestibility of microalgae-based aquafeed. Simultaneously, safety and regulatory aspects of microalgae feed applications, major challenges on the use microalgae in aquafeed in commercial production, and future research and development perspective are also presented in a critical manner. This review will serve as a useful guide to present current status of knowledge and highlight key areas for future development of a microalgae-based aquafeed industry and overall development of a sustainable aquaculture industry.},

	abstract = {We reviewed 148 assessments of animal source food ( ASF ) production for livestock, aquaculture, and capture fisheries that measured four metrics of environmental impact (energy use, greenhouse‐gas emissions, release of nutrients, and acidifying compounds) and standardized these per unit of protein production. We also examined additional literature on freshwater demand, pesticide use, and antibiotic use. There are up to 100‐fold differences in impacts between specific products and, in some cases, for the same product, depending on the production method being used. The lowest impact production methods were small pelagic fisheries and mollusk aquaculture, whereas the highest impact production methods were beef production and catfish aquaculture. Many production methods have not been evaluated, limiting our analysis to the range of studies that have been published. Regulatory restrictions on ASF production methods, as well as consumer guidance, should consider the relative environmental impact of these systems, since, currently, there appears to be little relationship between regulatory restrictions and impact in most developed countries.},

The conversion of these raw materials into marine ingredients is discussed and global volumes presented. This is followed by a summary of the main countries using these marine ingredients over recent years. Uses of fishmeal and fish-oil by market segment are then presented. From this, a global mass balance of inputs and outputs is derived which allows the calculation of the input-to-output ratios (fish in:fish out; FIFO) for the main aquaculture production types to be made. Current areas of focus by the industry include the need to demonstrate sustainable practice, more strategic use of marine ingredients, greater use of fishery and land-animal by-products as well as vegetable substitutes, and novel sources of essential omega-3 fats, notably the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids.

The contents of fish meal and fish oil in the salmon feed were 18\% and 11\%, respectively, in 2013.

Norwegian salmon farming consumed 1.63 million tonnes of feed ingredients in 2012, containing close to 40 million GJ of energy, 580,000 tonnes of protein and 530,000 tonnes of lipid. 1.26 million tonnes of salmon was produced. Assuming an edible yield of 65\%, 820,000 tonnes of salmon fillet, containing 9.44 million GJ, and 156,000 tonnes of protein were produced.

The retentions of EPA and DHA were 46\% in whole salmon and 26\% in fillets, respectively. The fish in/fish out ratio (FIFO) measures the amount of fish meal and fish oil that is used to produce one weight equivalent of farmed fish back to wild fish weight equiva- lents, and the forage fish dependency ratio (FFDR) is the amount of wild caught fish used to produce the amount of fish meal and fish oil required to produce 1 kg of salmon. From 1990 to 2013, the forage fish dependency ratio for fish meal decreased from 4.4 to 0.7 in Norwegian salmon farming. However, weight-to-weight ratios such as FIFO and FFDR do not account for the different nutrient contents in the salmon product and in the forage fish used for fish meal and fish oil production. Marine nutrient dependency ratios express the amount of marine oil and protein required to produce 1 kg of salmon oil and protein. In 2013, 0.7 kg of marine protein was used to produce 1 kg of salmon protein, so the Norwegian farmed salmon is thus a net producer of marine protein.},

The IM and IO were produced from black soldier fly larvae ( Hermetia illucens , L.; BSF) that had been grown on (1) media containing organic waste streams, or on (2) media partially containing seaweed ( Ascophyllum nodosum ). The feeding trial of the current study followed a factorial 2×3 way-ANOVA experimental design with six dietary groups of Atlantic salmon fed diets with insect-derived ingredients for 8weeks. A typical industrial diet, with protein from fish meal and soy protein concentrate (SPC) (50:50) and lipids from fish oil and vegetable oil (33:66), was fed to a positive control group. Five experimental diets were formulated, where 85\% of the dietary protein was replaced by IM and/or all the vegetable oil was replaced by IO (IM from insects grown on media 1, IO from insects grown on either media 1 (IO1) or media 2 (IO2)). Replacing the dietary fish meal and SPC with insect protein significantly reduced the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of protein, lipid and all amino acids investigated, though remained highly digestible. There were, however, only small differences due to protein or lipid source in growth performance, and no effects of insect ingredients on feed intake or feed conversion ratio. Inclusion of IM-based diets significantly increased both hepatosomatic index and visceral somatic index of Atlantic salmon. Proteinase activity in the intestine was not affected by dietary inclusion of BSF larvae meal, while leucine aminopeptidase activity was lower in fish fed with insect ingredients than the control group. Whole-body protein, lipid, amino acids and minerals contents were not affected by protein or lipid source. In general, this study showed that protein meal and oil from BSF larvae hold a great potential as a source of nutrients for Atlantic salmon.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is central in meeting expanding global demands for shrimp consumption. Consequently, increasing feed use is mainly responsible for the overall environmental impact of aquaculture production. Significant amounts of fishmeal are included in shrimp diets, causing dependency on finite marine resources. Driven by economic incentives, terrestrial plant ingredients are widely viewed as sustainable alternatives. Incremental fishmeal substitution by plant ingredients in shrimp feed was modeled and effects on marine and terrestrial resources such as fish, land, freshwater, nitrogen, and phosphorus were assessed. We find that complete substitution of 20–30\% fishmeal totals could lead to increasing demand for freshwater (up to 63\%), land (up to 81\%), and phosphorus (up to 83\%), while other substitution rates lead to proportionally lower impacts. These findings suggest additional pressures on essential agricultural resources with associated socio-economic and environmental effects as a trade-off to pressures on finite marine resources. Even though the production of shrimp feed (or aquafeed in general) utilizes only a small percentage of the global crop production, the findings indicate that the sustainability of substituting fishmeal by plant ingredients should not be taken for granted, especially since aquaculture has been one of the fastest growing food sectors. Therefore, the importance of utilizing by-products and novel ingredients such as microbial biomass, algae, and insect meals in mitigating the use of marine and terrestrial resources is discussed.},

	abstract = {The finfish and crustacean aquaculture sector is still highly dependent upon marine capture fisheries for sourcing key dietary nutrient inputs, including fish meal and fish oil. This dependency is particularly strong within compound aquafeeds for farmed carnivorous finfish species and marine shrimp.
Results are presented concerning the responses received from a global survey conducted between December 2006 and October 2007 concerning the use of fish meal and fish oil within compound aquafeeds using a questionnaire sent to over 800 feed manufacturers, farmers, researchers, fishery specialists, and other stakeholders in over 50 countries. On the basis of the responses received, it is estimated that in 2006 the aquaculture sector consumed 3724 thousand tonnes of fish meal (68.2\% total global fish meal production in 2006) and 835 thousand tonnes of fish oil (88.5\% total reported fish oil production in 2006), or the equivalent of 16.6 million tonnes of small pelagic forage fish (using a wet fish to fish meal processing yield of 22.5\% and wet fish to fish oil processing yield of 5\%) with an overall fish-in fish-out ratio of 0.70. At a species-group level, calculation of small pelagic forage fish input per unit of farmed fish or crustacean output showed steadily decreasing fish-in fish-out ratios for all cultivated species from 1995 to 2006, with decreases being most dramatic for carnivorous fish species such as salmon (decreasing from 7.5 to 4.9 from 1995 to 2006), trout (decreasing from 6.0 to 3.4), eel (decreasing from 5.2 to 3.5), marine fish (decreasing from 3.0 to 2.2) and to a lesser extent shrimp (decreasing by 1.9 to 1.4 from 1995 to 2006. Net fish producing species in 2006 (with fish-in fish-out ratios below 1), included herbivorous and omnivorous finfish and crustacean species, including non-filter feeding Chinese carp (0.2), milkfish (0.2), tilapia (0.4), catfish (0.5), and freshwater crustaceans (0.6).
On the basis of increasing global fish meal and fish oil costs, it is predicted that dietary fish meal and fish oil inclusion levels within compound aquafeeds will decrease in the long term, with fish meal and fish oil usage increasingly being targeted for use as a high value specialty feed ingredient for use within higher value starter, finisher and broodstock feeds, and by so doing extending supply of these much sought after and limited feed ingredient commodities.},

	abstract = {The environmental consequences of replacing fish meal and fish oil with plant-based sources in salmonid feeds were investigated using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Two scenarios of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farming were compared. The first scenario used a Standard Diet (STD) with high levels of fish meal and fish oil, and the second a Low Marine-Fishery-Capture Diet (LFD) in which fish meal and fish oil were replaced by plant protein and oil sources. Environmental impacts assessed were: acidification, eutrophication, climate change, terrestrial ecotoxicity, net primary production use (biotic resource use), water use, land occupation and total cumulative energy demand. The assessment confirmed the substantial contribution of feed to the environmental burdens of fish production and the LFD scenario led to a significant decrease in biotic resource use compared to the STD scenario with the same total energy demand. Environmental impacts of feeds depended highly on the geographic origins of feed ingredients from fishery (e.g., fish oil from Norway or Peru) and from terrestrial agricultural crop species (e.g., palm oil or rapeseed oil). This study demonstrated the importance of a multicriteria method to give stakeholders the most accurate information on the potential consequences of replacing fishery products with plant-based sources in aquafeeds.},

Beyond plant-based ingredients, fishery and aquaculture byproducts and insect meals have the greatest potential to supply the protein required by aquafeeds over the next 10–20 years. Food waste also has potential through the biotransformation and/or bioconversion of raw waste materials, whereas microbial and macroalgal biomass have limitations regarding their scalability and protein content, respectively.

The aim of this study is to assess the composition of five different fish feeds based on environmental, economic and social parameters using life cycle analysis (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), social life cycle analysis (S-LCA) as well as technical considerations. The impact of alternatives to the main feed ingredients was analysed separately, while the development of fish feed focused on the protein source used in the feed and the oil used, as halieutic resources are used as raw material in their production, and alternatives are being considered. The best alternatives, considering all four dimensions, were the alternatives where fishmeal protein was partially replaced by Black Solder fly and Yellow Mealworm protein, as the proportion replaced is different for each alternative. By evaluating fish feed along several dimensions, the aim is to improve fish welfare while reducing the environmental impact of feed production.},

	abstract = {An empirical model was applied to quantitatively model the effects of extrusion variables and recipe compositions on quality of feed pellets. Lab extrusion trials were performed with an Atlantic salmon feed recipe with using a central component design (CCD). Comparing with a coated commercial feed made with the same recipe, the lab extrusion pellets had similar bulk density, hardness, and durability properties. A Response Surface Method (RSM) was also used to regress the extrusion trial data and compared with the empirical model results. The respective Absolute Average Deviation (AAD\%) values of the empirical model and RSM regression were 4.1\% and 1.8\% for pellet bulk density, 7.4\% and 4.9\% for pellet hardness, 10.4\% and 10.0\% for pellet oil absorption, 13.7\% and 8.3\% for pellet water stability, and 11.3\% and 5.5\% for pellet durability. Using the model coefficients obtained from the extrusion results, the empirical model can partly extrapolate the pellet qualities of an additional extruded recipe, which has a slightly adjusted wheat gluten and wheat. The model performance was evaluated based on. R2, RSME (root-mean-square deviation), AAD\% of the empirical model was better than the RSM model to predict the effects of extrusion variables on pellet quality parameters. The effects of the extrusion process variables and recipe composition on pellet quality parameters are predicted by the empirical model. Its demonstrates that the empirical model is a new method to understand extrusion trial results in different extrusion systems and recipes without changing its mathematical form of expression, which gives a common reference to compare an extruded recipe in different systems and has practical engineering applications.},

	abstract = {Fed aquaculture has long been based on fishmeal (FM) as the main protein source for carnivorous species, but when its demand and price began increasing, both researchers and the industry started to search for alternative protein sources to meet the challenge of securing aquafeed. Consequently, this study has recourse to life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to identify any critical points and improvement strategies in the current production of four partial substitutes for FM namely dried microalgae biomass from Tetraselmis suecica (DMB\_TETRA) and Tisochrysis lutea (DMB\_TISO); insect meal (IM) from Hermetia illucens larvae; and poultry by-product meal (PBM). System boundaries are from the cradle to the mill gate, thus including the production phase (and the related upstream activities) and the subsequent biomass processing into unpackaged dried meal. One tonne of protein content was chosen as functional unit. The inventory was based on foreground data provided by the industry and complemented by background data sourced from the Ecoinvent v 3.4 and Agribalyse® v 1.3 LCI databases. The environmental effects were assessed considering five impacts namely global warming (kg CO2 eq.), acidification (kg SO2 eq.) and eutrophication (kg PO43− eq.) estimated via the CML-IA method, plus cumulative energy use (MJ) and water use (m3m−2month−1). Two alternative scenarios per production chain were considered in order to increase the robustness of the results. The performance-based ranking indicated the PBM and IM scenarios as the most sustainable options. Both microalgal systems scored the worst performances in four impacts out of five, with eutrophication impact as the only exception. The nutrients provided to poultry and insects (i.e. the feed) as well as to microalgae (the carbon source and the fertilizers) were the main contributors to impacts, together with energy consumption. Despite being cultivated with identical technologies, the two microalgae showed different performances due to their different annual yields and to different consumable goods, water and energy consumptions. The results provided a ranking of these four partial FM substitutes and allowed to make useful considerations on how to improve their environmental sustainability. To this regard, the impacts of IM and DMB production could be reduced by improving nutrient efficiency and reducing energy needs. On the other hand, PBM production is already optimized and is not expected to change substantially in the future years.},

	abstract = {Efficiency assessments of marine ingredient use in aquaculture are required to fully understand their contribution to global seafood supply and their impacts on all UN Sustainable Development Goals. Fish In: Fish Out (FIFO) ratios have become the principal metric used to ensure aquaculture does not negatively impact wild fish stocks. However, several approaches have been advocated to calculate the FIFO ratio and there have been criticisms that the different approaches employed lead to over- or under- estimates of the dependence of aquaculture on marine ingredients. Critically, FIFO does not align with Life Cycle Assessment as a measure of other environmental impacts. In this paper we present an alternative method to calculate the FIFO ratio based on the principle of economic allocation (economic Fish In: Fish Out – eFIFO) as commonly used in Life Cycle Assessments. Economic allocation acts as a proxy for the nutritional value of ingredients and places higher importance on the more limiting co-products generated and their relative demand. Substitution of marine ingredients by alternate feed ingredients has significantly reduced the amount of fishmeal and fish oil in aquafeed formulations for most farmed fish species, resulting in a continually decreasing FIFO ratio. Results show that most aquaculture species groups assessed in this study are net producers of fish, while salmon and trout aquaculture are net neutral, producing as much fish biomass as is consumed. Overall, global fed-aquaculture currently produces three to four times as much fish as it consumes. Tracking historical prices of fish oil against fishmeal, the relative higher price of fish oil leads to relatively higher allocation of fish to fish oil compared to fishmeal. This leads to relatively higher eFIFO for species with high fish oil requirements.},

As the fastest growing food sector in the world, fed aquaculture demand will eventually surpass ecological supply of forage fish, but when and how best to avoid this ecological boundary is unclear. Using global production data, feed use trends, and human consumption patterns, we show how combined actions of fisheries reform, reduced feed use by non-carnivorous aquaculture and agricultural species, and greater consistent inclusion of fish by-products in China-based production can circumvent forage fish limits by mid-century. However, we also demonstrate that the efficacies of such actions are diminished if global diets shift to more seafood-heavy (that is, pescatarian) diets and are further constrained by possible ecosystem-based fisheries regulations in the future. Long-term, nutrient-equivalent alternative feed sources are essential for more rapid and certain aquaculture sustainability.},

	abstract = {Unsustainable fishing practices have placed a heavy emphasis on aquaculture to meet the global shortfalls in the supply of fish and seafood, which are commonly accepted as the primary source of health-promoting essential omega-3 (n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids). However, dietary fish oil is required for the production of omega-3-rich farmed fish and this commodity, in a vicious circle, is at present derived solely from wild fisheries. Decreasing global availability coupled with the highly variable price of this resource has forced the aquaculture industry to investigate the possibilities of alternative dietary lipid sources. This review attempts to compile all principal information available regarding the effects of fish oil replacement for the diets of farmed finfish, analysing the findings using a comparative approach among different cultured fish species. The review initially focuses on the present situation with regard to the production, availability and main nutritional characteristics of fish oil and the principal alternative lipid sources (such as vegetable oils and animal fats). Following this, the effects of fish oil replacement in finfish nutrition on feed quality, fish performance, feed efficiency, fish lipid metabolism, final eating quality and related economic aspects are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector and continues to expand alongside terrestrial crop and livestock production. Using portfolio theory as a conceptual framework, we explore how current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change. Aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, aquaculture’s reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminishes its ability to add resilience. Feeds for livestock and farmed fish that are fed rely largely on the same crops, although the fraction destined for aquaculture is presently small (∼4\%). As demand for high-value fed aquaculture products grows, competition for these crops will also rise, as will the demand for wild fish as feed inputs. Many of these crops and forage fish are also consumed directly by humans and provide essential nutrition for low-income households. Their rising use in aquafeeds has the potential to increase price levels and volatility, worsening food insecurity among the most vulnerable populations. Although the diversification of global food production systems that includes aquaculture offers promise for enhanced resilience, such promise will not be realized if government policies fail to provide adequate incentives for resource efficiency, equity, and environmental protection.},

	abstract = {Humanity depends on the marine environment for a range of vital ecosystem services, at global (e.g. climate regulation), regional (e.g. commercial fisheries) and local scales (e.g. coastal defence and recreation). At the same time, marine ecosystems have been exploited for centuries, and many systems today are under stress from multiple sources. Recent studies have shown how both climate change and fishing have caused long-term changes in the marine environment. However, there is still poor understanding of how these changes influence change in coastal ecosystem services. In this paper, an integrated modelling approach is used to assess how the final delivery of marine ecosystem services to coastal communities is influenced by the direct and indirect effects of changes in ecosystem processes brought about by climate and human impacts, using fisheries of the North Sea region as a case study. Partial least squares path analysis is used to explore the relationships between drivers of change, marine ecosystem processes and services (landings). A simple conceptual model with four variables—climate, fishing effort, ecosystem process and ecosystem services—is applied to the English North Sea using historic ecological, climatic and fisheries time series spanning 1924–2010 to identify the multiple pathways that might exist. As expected, direct and indirect links between fishing effort, ecosystem processes and service provision were significant. However, links between climate and ecosystem processes were weak. This paper highlights how path analysis can be used for analysing long-term temporal links between ecosystem processes and services following a simplified pathway.},

The use of novel aquaculture feed ingredients is growing, but their contributions to scalable and sustainable aquafeed solutions are unclear. Here, we show that global adoption of novel aquafeeds could substantially reduce aquaculture’s forage fish demand by 2030, maintaining feed efficiencies and omega-3 fatty acid profiles. We combine production data, scenario modelling and a decade of experimental data on forage fish replacement using microalgae, macroalgae, bacteria, yeast and insects to illustrate how reducing future fish oil demand, particularly in high-value species such as salmonids, will be key for the sustainability of fed aquaculture. However, considerable uncertainties remain surrounding novel feed efficacy across different life-cycle stages and taxa, and various social, environmental, economic and regulatory challenges will dictate their widespread use. Yet, we demonstrate how even limited adoption of novel feeds could aid sustainable aquaculture growth, which will become increasingly important for food security. Novel aquaculture feeds are rapidly developing, but their contributions to sustainable industry growth are unknown.

Here, we assess and highlight development challenges for fisheries-dependent countries based on analyses of interactions and trade-offs between goals focusing on food, biodiversity and climate change. We demonstrate that some countries are likely to face double jeopardies in both fisheries and agriculture sectors under climate change. The strategies to mitigate these risks will be context-dependent, and will need to directly address the trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals, such as halting biodiversity loss and reducing poverty. Countries with low adaptive capacity but increasing demand for food require greater support and capacity building to transition towards reconciling trade-offs. Necessary actions are context-dependent and include effective governance, improved management and conservation, maximizing societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability of distribution and innovation in food production, including continued development of low input and low impact aquaculture.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15499},
	abstract = {Fed aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing and most valuable food production industries in the world. The efficiency with which farmed fish convert feed into biomass influences both environmental impact and economic revenue. Salmonid species, such as king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), exhibit high levels of plasticity in vital rates such as feed intake and growth rates. Accurate estimations of individual variability in vital rates are important for production management. The use of mean trait values to evaluate feeding and growth performance can mask individual-level differences that potentially contribute to inefficiencies. Here, the authors apply a cohort integral projection model (IPM) framework to investigate individual variation in growth performance of 1625 individually tagged king salmon fed one of three distinct rations of 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% satiation and tracked over a duration of 276 days. To capture the observed sigmoidal growth of individuals, they compared a nonlinear mixed-effects (logistic) model to a linear model used within the IPM framework. Ration significantly influenced several aspects of growth, both at the individual and at the cohort level. Mean final body mass and mean growth rate increased with ration; however, variance in body mass and feed intake also increased significantly over time. Trends in mean body mass and individual body mass variation were captured by both logistic and linear models, suggesting the linear model to be suitable for use in the IPM. The authors also observed that higher rations resulted in a decreasing proportion of individuals reaching the cohort's mean body mass or larger by the end of the experiment. This suggests that, in the present experiment, feeding to satiation did not produce the desired effects of efficient, fast, and uniform growth in juvenile king salmon. Although monitoring individuals through time is challenging in commercial aquaculture settings, recent technological advances combined with an IPM approach could provide new scope for tracking growth performance in experimental and farmed populations. Using the IPM framework might allow the exploration of other size-dependent processes affecting vital rate functions, such as competition and mortality.},

	abstract = {Food production, particularly of fed animals, is a leading cause of environmental degradation globally.1,2 Understanding where and how much environmental pressure different fed animal products exert is critical to designing effective food policies that promote sustainability.3 Here, we assess and compare the environmental footprint of farming industrial broiler chickens and farmed salmonids (salmon, marine trout, and Arctic char) to identify opportunities to reduce environmental pressures. We map cumulative environmental pressures (greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient pollution, freshwater use, and spatial disturbance), with particular focus on dynamics across the land and sea. We found that farming broiler chickens disturbs 9 times more area than farming salmon (∼924,000 vs. ∼103,500 km2) but yields 55 times greater production. The footprints of both sectors are extensive, but 95\% of cumulative pressures are concentrated into {\textless}5\% of total area. Surprisingly, the location of these pressures is similar (85.5\% spatial overlap between chicken and salmon pressures), primarily due to shared feed ingredients. Environmental pressures from feed ingredients account for {\textgreater}78\% and {\textgreater}69\% of cumulative pressures of broiler chicken and farmed salmon production, respectively, and could represent a key leverage point to reduce environmental footprints. The environmental efficiency (cumulative pressures per tonne of production) also differs geographically, with areas of high efficiency revealing further potential to promote sustainability. The propagation of environmental pressures across the land and sea underscores the importance of integrating food policies across realms and sectors to advance food system sustainability.},

Despite the growing concerns over their environmental impacts, limited attention has been paid to how blue food production is influenced by anthropogenic environmental changes. Here we assess the vulnerability of global blue food systems to predominant environmental disturbances and predict the spatial impacts. Over 90\% of global blue food production faces substantial risks from environmental change, with the major producers in Asia and the United States facing the greatest threats. Capture fisheries generally demonstrate higher vulnerability than aquaculture in marine environments, while the opposite is true in freshwater environments. While threats to production quantity are widespread across marine and inland systems, food safety risks are concentrated within a few countries. Identifying and supporting mitigation and adaptation measures in response to environmental stressors is particularly important in developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa where risks are high and national response capacities are low. These findings lay groundwork for future work to map environmental threats and opportunities, aiding strategic planning and policy development for resilient and sustainable blue food production under changing conditions.},

RAC allows to simulate the rearing cycle of 4 species, finfish and shellfish, highly important in terms of production in the Mediterranean Sea. The package works both at the scale of the individual and of the farmed population. Mathematical models included in RAC were all validated in previous works, and account for growth and metabolism, based on input data characterizing the forcing functions—water temperature, and food quality/quantity. The package provides a demo dataset of forcings for each species, as well as a typical set of husbandry parameters for Mediterranean conditions. The present work illustrates RAC main features, and its current capabilities/limitations. Three test cases are presented as a proof of concept of RAC applicability, and to demonstrate its potential for integrating different open products nowadays provided by remote sensing and operational oceanography.},

	abstract = {Reduced dependence on wild-caught fish in favour of crop-based ingredients for feeds has been crucial for sustaining growth in fed aquaculture. However, the net environmental implications of  displacing feed provisioning burdens from marine to terrestrial systems remain understudied  with little attention to multiple environmental pressures or the importance of where ingredients are sourced from. Here we model the change in environmental footprint (a cumulative and  spatial measure of greenhouse gas emissions, habitat disturbance, excess nutrient, and water consumption pressures) of shifting dependence from largely fish-based to plant-based ingredients   in feeds for Atlantic salmon farming. We show that average differences exist between feeds in their cumulative and individual environmental pressures, but more importantly, the locations where feed raw materials are produced and processed drives far more variability in footprint within a feed than the typical variation between feeds. We demonstrate that responsible sourcing  will be critical for sustainable feed production across all farming systems as the next generation of ingredients are developed.},

	abstract = {The steady increase in production volume of salmon aquaculture has sharpened concerns about its sustainability. In particular the production of salmon feed is a reason for concern given its reliance on scarce natural resources, such as wild fish captures. Multi-scale integrated analysis is put forward as a tool to anticipate the environmental and socio-economic impacts of large-scale implementation of alternative salmon feeds, considering both plant and insect sources as potential replacements of fish meal and fish oil. The proposed accounting framework, based on relational analysis across hierarchical levels, describes the patterns of required inputs using biophysical and economic variables. It also considers the inputs used by external systems for the production of imported feed, thus providing a coherent assessment of the sustainability of the production system in terms of feasibility, viability, and desirability. The analytical tool-kit is illustrated in conceptual terms and then applied to the Norwegian salmon aquaculture, both in diagnostic (describing the actual situation) and anticipatory mode (examining feed scenarios). Results are used in an exercise of quantitative story-telling to check the quality of the narratives currently shaping policy discussions on aquaculture. Quantitative story-telling is a heuristic approach aimed at checking the robustness of knowledge claims in face of uncertainty. It is concluded that rearing insects in the salmon feed production chain enlarges the option space of feed sources by opening up the possibility of using locally-produced seaweed and organic waste, but also raises the level of uncertainty with regard to the possible insurgence of negative side effects.},

While previous research has evaluated the environmental pressures of feed production, no spatially explicit global biodiversity assessment of animal feeds exists. Here, we assess biodiversity impacts on 54,628 marine and terrestrial species for two simplified but plausible Atlantic salmon feeds. We find widespread impact on both marine ({\textasciitilde}89\%) and terrestrial ({\textasciitilde}71\%) species, though the average magnitude of impact is small. Despite minimising wild-sourced fishmeal and oil by necessity, increased agricultural dependence for feed provisioning appears to have disproportionately increased impacts on terrestrial taxa. Our results provide key information for sourcing aquafeed to minimise impacts and optimise sustainability. As the aquaculture industry expands to feed billions more, a standardised and integrative approach to assess and potentially forecast the effects of feed on global biodiversity is essential for informed decision-making.},

	abstract = {The diverse aquaculture sector makes important contributions toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/Agenda 2030, and can increasingly do so in the future. Its important role for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, economies, and cultures is not clearly visible in the Agenda 21 declaration. This may partly reflect the state of development of policies for aquaculture compared with its terrestrial counterpart, agriculture, and possibly also because aquaculture production has historically originated from a few key hotspot regions/countries. This review highlights the need for better integration of aquaculture in global food system dialogues. Unpacking aquaculture's diverse functions and generation of values at multiple spatiotemporal scales enables better understanding of aquaculture's present and future potential contribution to the SDGs. Aquaculture is a unique sector that encompasses all aquatic ecosystems (freshwater, brackish/estuarine, and marine) and is also tightly interconnected with terrestrial ecosystems through, for example, feed resources and other dependencies. Understanding environmental, social, and economic characteristics of the multifaceted nature of aquaculture provides for more context-specific solutions for addressing both opportunities and challenges for its future development. This review includes a rapid literature survey based on how aquaculture links to the specific SDG indicators. A conceptual framework is developed for communicating the importance of context specificity related to SDG outcomes from different types of aquaculture. The uniqueness of aquaculture's contributions compared with other food production systems are discussed, including understanding of species/systems diversity, the role of emerging aquaculture, and its interconnectedness with supporting systems. A selection of case studies is presented to illustrate: (1) the diversity of the aquaculture sector and what role this diversity can play for contributions to the SDGs, (2) examples of methodologies for identification of aquaculture's contribution to the SDGs, and (3) trade-offs between farming systems’ contribution to meeting the SDGs. It becomes clear that decision-making around resource allocation and trade-offs between aquaculture and other aquatic resource users needs review of a wide range of established and emergent systems. The review ends by highlighting knowledge gaps and pathways for transformation that will allow further strengthening of aquaculture's role for contributing to the SDGs. This includes identification and building on already existing monitoring that can enable capturing SDG-relevant aquaculture statistics at a national level and discussion of how a cohesive and comprehensive aquaculture strategy, framed to meet the SDGs, may help countries to prioritize actions for improving well-being.},

The null hypothesis was that test species, abundance, and biomass curves (SAB) from the shelf closely resemble those from the model. Principal areas of agreement between test curves and model curves include increased abundance and biomass approaching an ocean outfall. Major departures from the PRM include: (1) no sharp decline in SAB curves to azoic conditions, (2) displacement of SAB curves away from the outfall, and (3) opportunistic species did not exclude or eliminate rare species. Moreover, the role of local dominant species (bivalve—Parvilucina tenuisculpta, ostracod—Euphilomedes carcharodonta polychaetous annelid—Capitella capitata) can greatly influence SAB curves within the model. Bioenhancement should not necessarily be viewed as a diagnostic feature of a polluted site. Since the PRM was originally developed for semi-enclosed, low energy depositional habitats with long residence times (fjords, sea lochs), open ocean, high energy, erosional habitats (coast and shelf) may not be the most appropriate sites to apply this model. Uncritical application of the PRM to the Orange County ocean outfall may lead to unnecessary and costly decisions.},

	abstract = {The Pearson and Rosenberg (P-R) conceptual model of macrobenthic succession was used to assess the impact of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration ≤2 mg L–1) on the macrobenthic community on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The stress-response relationship between bottom-water oxygen concentration and the macrobenthic community was used to determine the ecological condition of the benthic habitat. In lieu of testing the effect of decreasing influence of organic enrichment on the macrobenthic community as a function of distance from the source of organic pollution, we tested the effect of bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentration as a proxy for distance from the source. To include the seasonal response in the long-term cumulative effect of recurring hypoxia on the macrobenthic community, samples were collected during early spring (April 2009), late summer (September 2009), and midsummer (August 2010). The cumulative effect of annual hypoxia on the macrobenthos at each site was apparent from the species diversity, abundance, and biomass. High diversity values at site H7 and low diversity values at site A6 indicated the existence of a westward-diminishing hypoxic gradient on the Louisiana/Texas shelf, interrupted by the Atchafalaya River discharge. Unsurprisingly, the macrobenthos collected during midsummer were generally the most stressed community, with the exception of site E4. Assessment of successional stages of the benthic communities of the four sites with multivariate analyses of nonmetric multidimensional scaling, distance-based redundancy analysis, and principal component analysis identified the influence of bottom-water hypoxia. The study demonstrated the applicability of the P-R model in predicting successional change in the macrobenthic community on the Louisiana continental shelf. Site H7 was in the advanced phase of stage II, sites E4 and D5 were in the intermediate phase of stage II, and site A6 was in the intermediate phase of stage I in the P-R successional continuum.},

The diets were equal in gross energy, crude protein, lipids, carbohydrates, lysine and methionine plus cystine. Apparent digestibilities of energy and protein in fish meal, full-fat soybean meal and maize gluten meal were determined as 93.5\% (19.5 MJ digestible energy (DE) kg−1) and 89.3\%, 69.3\% (14.4 MJ DE kg−1) and 76.9\%, and 78.6\% (16.4 MJ DE kg−1) and 87.0\%, respectively. Tested by ANOVA and orthogonal polynomials, a linear reduction that approached significance and with no significant deviation from linearity was found in growth, SGR and TGC with increasing substitution of fish meal. Substitution of fish meal caused a significant linear reduction in the condition factor, while feed consumption was not affected. The effect of substitution on feed conversion ratio (FCR=g feed g−1 growth) showed a near significant deviation from linearity, FCR being significantly higher on Diet 3 than Diet 1 and slightly lower on Diet 2 than Diet 1. Apparent protein digestibility of the test diets decreased significantly linearly with increasing substitution, while no significant effects were found on digestibility of lipids and gross energy. Carbohydrate digestibility was low with no significant differences between diets. Fish meal substitution had no significant effect on carcass content of moisture, protein, ash or energy, while content of fat was nearly significantly linearly reduced. Substitution caused a nominal insignificant linear reduction in protein accretion but had no effect on digestible protein consumption per gram of protein accretion. Protein efficiency ratio (PER=weight gain/protein consumption) decreased significantly curvilinearly and net protein value (NPV=carcass protein gain/protein consumption) significantly linearly with increasing substitution. Energy utilization for growth decreased significantly linearly with increasing substitution. There was a nominal linear reduction, which approached significance in energy accretion with increasing substitution. Substitution impaired energy utilization for energy accretion (i.e. increased MJ DE consumed/MJ accredited).},

The consequences for fisheries and agriculture production potential are well studied, yet the possible outcomes for aquaculture (that is, aquatic farming)—one of the fastest growing food sectors on the planet—remain a major gap in scientific understanding. With over one-third of aquaculture produced in marine waters and this proportion increasing, it is critical to anticipate new opportunities and challenges in marine production under climate change. Here, we model and map the effect of warming ocean conditions (Representative Concentration Pathway scenario 8.5) on marine aquaculture production potential over the next century, based on thermal tolerance and growth data of 180 cultured finfish and bivalve species. We find heterogeneous patterns of gains and losses, but an overall greater probability of declines worldwide. Accounting for multiple drivers of species growth, including shifts in temperature, chlorophyll and ocean acidification, reveals potentially greater declines in bivalve aquaculture compared with finfish production. This study addresses a missing component in food security research and sustainable development planning by identifying regions that will face potentially greater climate change challenges and resilience with regards to marine aquaculture in the coming decades. Understanding the scale and magnitude of future increases and reductions in aquaculture potential is critical for designing effective and efficient use and protection of the oceans, and ultimately for feeding the planet sustainably.},

However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015\% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives.},

	abstract = {Land-based hatcheries are now capable of growing large Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts (approximately 150 – 1000 g), which means that marine net-pens can be stocked with substantially larger fish compared to traditional stocking sizes ({\textless} 150 g). This stocking strategy typically aims to reduce the time required for fish to grow to market size in the marine environment and limit risks (e.g., exposure to pathogens and diseases, opportunities for escapes). This study investigates another potential application of this strategy: the use of novel sites in areas previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture due to seasonally cold temperatures. The thermal-unit growth coefficient (TGC) model was applied to estimate the stocking weight needed to reach a harvest size of 5.5 kg, based on observed degree days for three sites. High resolution, depth-partitioned temperature time series from coastal locations in Atlantic Canada were used to represent a short, medium, and long growing season, as constrained by seasonal temperature extremes. Growing days for model inputs were defined as temperatures {\textgreater} 4 °C and trending up for stocking, {\textless} 18 °C to account for heat stress, and {\textgreater} -0.7 °C to avoid superchill conditions. Different TGC values were applied to simulate remedial, average, and elite growth performance. There was a range of model stocking weight estimates for each site (1.5 – 2.5 kg, 0.94 – 2.8 kg, and {\textless} 0.1 – 0.52 kg, for the short, medium, and long season sites, respectively). Results were sensitive to the number of degree days, heat stress threshold, and TGC value. At the two sites where season length was constrained by superchill, fish with a stocking weight of approximately 1.5 kg could grow to market size in shallow water depths ({\textless} 15 m), assuming elite growth performance. This investigation suggests that with appropriate growth performance assumptions and high-resolution temperature data, large post-smolt stocking strategies could enable the use of novel sites in coastal areas previously considered unsuitable for aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Mortality in the production of farmed salmonids is a major constraint to the sustainability of this form of animal husbandry. We have developed a model for the daily mortality in salmon farming over a full production cycle from stocking to harvest, considering different environmental and production factors. These factors included sea temperature, salinity, day within year, fish weight at stocking, stocking day, four types of lice treatments and the possible occurrence of pancreas disease (PD). We considered a generalized additive model following full production cycles, allowing for non-linear descriptions of how relevant factors relate to the daily mortality. We saw a high overall mortality rate immediately after stocking, which decreased the first three months in the cycle and thereafter increased. We found that the total mortality could be reduced by 21\% if avoiding all lice treatments, and similarly reduced by 20\% if no PD infections occurred. If avoiding jointly PD and all lice treatments, the accumulated mortality could be reduced by 34\%. A single thermal or hydrogen peroxide treatment was associated with a mortality of around 1.6\% and 1.3\%, respectively. This modeling approach gave a unique opportunity to model how different factors interact on the overall global mortality and can easily be extended by other factors, such as additional fish diseases.},

Atlantic salmon respiration data were compiled from a meta-analysis of 26 publications, and exponential or optimal relationships were fitted to the metadata to estimate respiration equation parameters and generate confidence intervals dependent on temperature and body mass. While model parameters were significant for both models, mass-corrected standard metabolic rates (g O2·day−1) increased as a function of water temperature (°C) and decreased beyond ∼16 °C following an optimal relationship (AICoptimal = –9185.50 versus AICexponential = –8948.95; ΔAIC = 236.55). Juvenile Atlantic salmon growth (cohorts 1 and 2) from bioenergetics simulations did not vary between Little Southwest Miramichi and Northwest Miramichi rivers; however, variation between simulations using the different respiration models (i.e., exponential versus optimal) led to differences in the way fish allocate energy throughout the year. Results from this analysis will inform conservation efforts for the species throughout its current range and predict the energetic requirements at juvenile life stages.},

The growth and feeding models were also applied to groups of Atlantic Salmon growing and feeding at rates below the maximum. The data were fitted to the Ratkowsky model, originally developed for bacterial growth. 2 The rates of growth and food consumption varied significantly among populations but the variation appeared unrelated to thermal conditions in the river of population origins. No correlation was found between the thermal conditions and limits for growth, thermal growth optima or maximum growth, and hypotheses of population-specific thermal adaptation were not supported. Estimated optimum temperatures for growth were between 16 and 20 °C. 3 Model parameter estimates differed among growth-groups in that maximum growth and the performance breadth decreased from fast to slow growing individuals. The optimum temperature for growth did not change with growth rate. 4 The model for food consumption (expressed in energy terms) peaked at 19–21 °C, which is only slightly higher than the optimal temperature for growth. Growth appeared directly related to food consumption. Consumption was initiated ≈2 °C below the lower temperature for growth and terminated ≈1·5 °C above the upper critical temperature for growth. Model parameter estimates for consumption differed among growth-groups in a manner similar to the growth models. 5 By combining the growth and consumption models, growth efficiencies were estimated. The maximum efficiencies were high, 42–58\%, and higher in rivers offering hostile than benign feeding and growth opportunities.},

	abstract = {Understanding how the current warming trends affect fish populations is crucial for effective conservation and management. To help define suitable thermal habitat for juvenile Chinook salmon, the thermal performance of juvenile Chinook salmon acclimated to either 15 or 19°C was tested across a range of environmentally relevant acute temperature changes (from 12 to 26°C). Swim tunnel respirometers were used to measure routine oxygen uptake as a measure of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and oxygen uptake when swimming maximally as a measure of maximal metabolic rate (MMR) at each test temperature. We estimated absolute aerobic scope (AAS = MMR − RMR), the capacity to supply oxygen beyond routine needs, as well as factorial aerobic scope (FAS = MMR/RMR). All fish swam at a test temperature of 23°C regardless of acclimation temperature, but some mortality occurred at 25°C during MMR measurements. Overall, RMR and MMR increased with acute warming, but aerobic capacity was unaffected by test temperatures up to 23°C in both acclimation groups. The mean AAS for fish acclimated and tested at 15°C (7.06 ± 1.76 mg O2 kg−1 h−1) was similar to that measured for fish acclimated and tested at 19°C (8.80 ± 1.42 mg O2 kg−1 h−1). Over the entire acute test temperature range, while MMR and AAS were similar for the two acclimation groups, RMR was significantly lower and FAS consequently higher at the lower test temperatures for the fish acclimated at 19°C. Thus, this stock of juvenile Chinook salmon shows an impressive aerobic capacity when acutely warmed to temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limit, regardless of the acclimation temperature. These results are compared with those for other salmonids, and the implications of our findings for informing management actions are discussed.},

Despite this threat to salmon aquaculture, most of our knowledge of this species' thermal biology is at temperatures above 10 °C. In this laboratory experiment, Atlantic salmon post-smolts (175 ± 24 g) were exposed to a temperature decline of 1 °C/week (from 8 to 1 °C) with an additional week at 1 °C (to simulate temperature changes in sea-cages in Atlantic Canada during the winter months), or a constant temperature of 8 °C (control), and sampled weekly. Growth was reduced by 58\% in the cold-exposed group and was associated with a decrease in appetite beginning at 6 °C. Starting at 4–5 °C, an osmoregulatory disturbance ensued characterized by higher plasma [Cl−], lower plasma [K+] and increased osmolality. Hsp70 and hsp90 transcript expression also increased as temperature was reduced from 5 to 1 °C. However, plasma cortisol levels did not increase (to ∼18 ng/ml) until the fish reached 1 °C, and serpinh1 and cirbp expression were not good biomarkers of decreasing temperature. Symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction (changes in plasma [aspartate aminotransferase] and an increase in liver size) were also evident at 1 °C. Finally, at 1 °C, 5\% of the fish died, and these mortalities were typically associated with snout ulceration/erosion and fin rot. In summary, Atlantic salmon held at temperatures {\textless}5 °C suffer from decreased growth performance, osmoregulatory disturbance, liver dysfunction, stress, opportunistic infections, and increased mortality.},

The devised model includes parameters for both maintenance and protein demands; the effect of fish live-weight on maintenance protein (LW0.697), lipid (LW0.972), and energy demands (LW0.815); the efficiencies of protein, lipid and energy utilisation at various protein, lipid and energy intake levels; and the variability in whole body composition with varying live-weight.

However, the maintenance requirements for both energy (74.3kJ/kgBW0.8/d− at 28°C) and protein (0.99g/kgBW0.7/d at 27.9°C) were about double to other species.

Growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and stomach evacuation rate were significantly influenced by temperature and fish size. Highest growth rate was seen in the 14 °C group (1.53\% d−1), no differences in growth were seen between the 10 and 18 °C groups (1.35\% d−1, 1.29\% d−1), and lowest growth observed at 6 °C (0.78\% d−1) group. Optimal temperature for growth (ToptG) increased with fish size, whereas optimal temperature for feed conversion efficiency (ToptFCE) decreased as fish size increased. The results suggest an optimum temperature for growth of 12.8 °C for 70–150 g to 14.0 °C for 150–300 g post-smolts. Optimum temperature for FCE dropped from 13.4 °C to 11.0 °C for the same size classes. A wide parabolic regression curve between growth, feed conversion efficiency and temperature indicates high temperature tolerance of Atlantic salmon in this size range studied. Highest stomach evacuation rate was seen in the 18 °C group, where the proportion of meal remaining in the stomach decreased from 100 to less than 5\% after 24 h of starvation. No differences in stomach evacuation rate were recorded between the 10 and 14 °C groups, whereas a significant delay in stomach evacuation was seen in the 6 °C group. Overall, these findings may have important consequences for optimization of commercial production of Atlantic salmon post-smolts.},

Spawning expenditure increased from 34 to 53\% for 55- to 72-cm-long females. In males, similar losses were from 47 to 49\% of their total energy content at river entry. More energy was used in reproduction in a long river than in a short one. Male allocation to gonads relative to soma was highest in the shorter river.

The fish were captured during summer, autumn and spring using two commercial fishing methods (jigging and bottom nets). Overall, the fillet quality of FA saithe was good, although it was clearly reduced for almost 10\% of the catch. Moreover, the quality of the FA saithe was significantly reduced compared with UA saithe, but the differences were small. Our results also showed that fish caught with jigging had better quality than fish caught with nets, and that fish that died in the nets were of lower quality than fish that were alive after hauling. There was no clear variation among seasons in fillet quality. Although no major and overall differences in quality were found between FA and UA saithe, reduced quality for even a modest proportion of the fish may influence the value of the total catch.},

	abstract = {Marine species and ecosystems are widely affected by anthropogenic stressors, ranging from pollution and fishing to climate change. Comprehensive assessments of how species and ecosystems are impacted by anthropogenic stressors are critical for guiding conservation and management investments. Previous global risk or vulnerability assessments have focused on marine habitats, or on limited taxa or specific regions. However, information about the susceptibility of marine species across a range of taxa to different stressors everywhere is required to predict how marine biodiversity will respond to human pressures. We present a novel framework that uses life-history traits to assess species' vulnerability to a stressor, which we compare across more than 44,000 species from 12 taxonomic groups (classes). Using expert elicitation and literature review, we assessed every combination of each of 42 traits and 22 anthropogenic stressors to calculate each species' or representative species group's sensitivity and adaptive capacity to stressors, and then used these assessments to derive their overall relative vulnerability. The stressors with the greatest potential impact were related to biomass removal (e.g., fisheries), pollution, and climate change. The taxa with the highest vulnerabilities across the range of stressors were mollusks, corals, and echinoderms, while elasmobranchs had the highest vulnerability to fishing-related stressors. Traits likely to confer vulnerability to climate change stressors were related to the presence of calcium carbonate structures, and whether a species exists across the interface of marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric realms. Traits likely to confer vulnerability to pollution stressors were related to planktonic state, organism size, and respiration. Such a replicable, broadly applicable method is useful for informing ocean conservation and management decisions at a range of scales, and the framework is amenable to further testing and improvement. Our framework for assessing the vulnerability of marine species is the first critical step toward generating cumulative human impact maps based on comprehensive assessments of species, rather than habitats.},

	abstract = {Nutrition and feeding influence growth, reproduction, and health of fish and their response to physiologic and environmental stressors and pathogens. The basics of fish metabolism are similar to those of warm-blooded animals in that they involve food intake, digestion, absorption, and transport of nutrients to the various tissues. Fish, however, being the most primitive form of vertebrates, possess some distinguishing features which will be discussed. Unlike warm-blooded animals, which are homoeothermic, fish are poikilothermic, so their body temperature and metabolic rate depends on the water temperature and this has practical implications for the nutrition, feeding and health of fish. Several behavioral responses have been linked to methods of feeding, feeding habits, frequency of feeding, mechanisms of food detection, and food preferences. Fish are also unique among vertebrates in their ability to absorb minerals not only from their diets but also from water through their gills and skin.},

	abstract = {Humans interact with the oceans in diverse and profound ways. The scope, magnitude, footprint and ultimate cumulative impacts of human activities can threaten ocean ecosystems and have changed over time, resulting in new challenges and threats to marine ecosystems. A fundamental gap in understanding how humanity is affecting the oceans is our limited knowledge about the pace of change in cumulative impact on ocean ecosystems from expanding human activities – and the patterns, locations and drivers of most significant change. To help address this, we combined high resolution, annual data on the intensity of 14 human stressors and their impact on 21 marine ecosystems over 11 years (2003–2013) to assess pace of change in cumulative impacts on global oceans, where and how much that pace differs across the ocean, and which stressors and their impacts contribute most to those changes. We found that most of the ocean (59\%) is experiencing significantly increasing cumulative impact, in particular due to climate change but also from fishing, land-based pollution and shipping. Nearly all countries saw increases in cumulative impacts in their coastal waters, as did all ecosystems, with coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves at most risk. Mitigation of stressors most contributing to increases in overall cumulative impacts is urgently needed to sustain healthy oceans.},

	abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems face a host of pressures from both offshore and land-based human activity. Research on terrestrial threats to coastal ecosystems has primarily focused on agricultural runoff, specifically showcasing how fertilizers and livestock waste create coastal eutrophication, harmful algae blooms, or hypoxic or anoxic zones. These impacts not only harm coastal species and ecosystems but also impact human health and economic activities. Yet few studies have assessed impacts of human wastewater on coastal ecosystems and community health. As such, we have lacked a comprehensive, fine-resolution, global assessment of the inputs and impacts of human sewage inputs that captures both pathogens and nutrient flows to coastal waters and the potential impacts on coastal ecosystems. To address this gap, we use a new high-resolution geospatial model to measure and map nitrogen (N) and pathogen - fecal indicator organisms (FIO) - inputs from human sewage for {\textasciitilde}135,000 watersheds globally. Our modeled data is for 2015. The resulting dataset provides N and FIO wastewater inputs for each watershed globally (n = 134846). Data is provided at the watershed level, as well as the coastal 'pourpoint' (the location where the watershed empties into the ocean) and national-level estimates, as vector shape files (.shp). The N dataset separates the contribution from sewered, septic, and untreated (open deification) wastewater inputs to coastal waters. Furthermore, we provide global rasters (GeoTIFF .tif) of N coastal impacts created by propagating pourpoint N inputs for each treatment type into coastal waters using a plume model based on a logarithmic decay function. The N effluent plumes can be used to determine the extent to which different marine habitats are exposed to wastewater N. For full information, see: Tuholske, C.*, Halpern, B.

To address this gap, we use a new high-resolution geospatial model to measure and map nitrogen (N) and pathogen—fecal indicator organisms (FIO)—inputs from human sewage for {\textasciitilde}135,000 watersheds globally. Because solutions depend on the source, we separate nitrogen and pathogen inputs from sewer, septic, and direct inputs. Our model indicates that wastewater adds 6.2Tg nitrogen into coastal waters, which is approximately 40\% of total nitrogen from agriculture. Of total wastewater N, 63\% (3.9Tg N) comes from sewered systems, 5\% (0.3Tg N) from septic, and 32\% (2.0Tg N) from direct input. We find that just 25 watersheds contribute nearly half of all wastewater N, but wastewater impacts most coastlines globally, with sewered, septic, and untreated wastewater inputs varying greatly across watersheds and by country. Importantly, model results find that 58\% of coral and 88\% of seagrass beds are exposed to wastewater N input. Across watersheds, N and FIO inputs are generally correlated. However, our model identifies important fine-grained spatial heterogeneity that highlight potential tradeoffs and synergies essential for management actions. Reducing impacts of nitrogen and pathogens on coastal ecosystems requires a greater focus on where wastewater inputs vary across the planet. Researchers and practitioners can also overlay these global, high resolution, wastewater input maps with maps describing the distribution of habitats and species, including humans, to determine the where the impacts of wastewater pressures are highest. This will help prioritize conservation efforts.Without such information, coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them will remain imperiled.},
